# ðŸš€CrediGo

A sleek and efficient web application built with React and Vite.

This project leverages the power of Vite for a lightning-fast development experience, complete with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), and incorporates ESLint for maintaining code quality and consistency.

## Technologies Used

* **[React](https://react.dev/)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: A next-generation frontend tooling that provides an extremely fast development server and instant build.
* **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react)**: The official Vite plugin for React, utilizing Babel for Fast Refresh.
* **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the aim of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.

## Getting Started

To get CrediGo up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone github.com/Dadaisuk1/CrediGo_IT342
    cd rect-frontweb
    ```

    *(Replace `[YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]` with the actual URL of your project repository)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

    This will start the Vite development server. Open your browser and navigate to the address provided in the console (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Building for Production

To build an optimized version of CrediGo for deployment, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build

```

<p>
  This will create a dist directory containing the production-ready build of your application.
  
  Expanding ESLint Configuration
  For more robust code linting, especially in larger applications, consider expanding the ESLint configuration. If you are planning a production-grade application, we highly recommend exploring TypeScript for enhanced type safety and utilizing type-aware lint rules provided by typescript-eslint.
  
  You can refer to the official React + TypeScript Vite template for guidance on integrating TypeScript and typescript-eslint into your project.
